About
-----
A simple snake clone written in C++ SDL2. It has minimalisctic GUI, which was done through SDL2 TTF library.

Goals and results
-----------------
The goal of this project was to learn SDL2 as well as C++, and make a simple game with those tools. That's why I picked the snake as a game that I'll remake in it.
It took me around 350 lines of code to make the game, main file is a bit too messy, but for a small game like that it's alright. I didn't want to write a lot of boilerplate for such a small project. 
If I were to make a personal engine, I'd properly distribute everything into coresponding classes.  
Overall I can safely say, that this project is done.
